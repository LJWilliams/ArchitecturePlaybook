each pattern. Most of the patterns have code samples or snippets that
show how to implement the patterns using the features of Microsoft

run complex computing systems.We apply the principles of computer
science and engineering to the design and development of computing
systems: generally, large distributed ones. Sometimes, our task is
writing the software for those systems alongside our product development
counterparts; sometimes, our task is building all the additional pieces
those systems need, like backups or load balancing, ideally so they can
be reused across systems; and sometimes, our task is figuring out how to
apply existing solutions to new problems.

Providing a way to check the integrity of information transmitted over
or stored in an unreliable medium is a prime necessity in the world of
open computing and communications. Mechanisms that provide such
integrity checks based on a secret key are usually called message
authentication codes (MACs). Typically, message authentication codes are
used between two parties that share a secret key in order to
authenticate information transmitted between these parties. This
Standard defines a MAC that uses a cryptographic hash function in
conjunction with a secret key. This mechanism is called HMAC [HMAC].
HMAC shall use an Approved cryptographic hash function [FIPS180-3]. HMAC
uses the secret key for the calculation and verification of the MACs.
