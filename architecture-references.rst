   Sometimes, our task is writing the software for those systems
   alongside our product development counterparts; sometimes, our task
   is building all the additional pieces those systems need, like
   backups or load balancing, ideally so they can be reused across
   systems; and sometimes, our task is figuring out how to apply

.. container:: section

   Providing a way to check the integrity of information transmitted
   over or stored in an unreliable medium is a prime necessity in the
   world of open computing and communications. Mechanisms that provide
   such integrity checks based on a secret key are usually called
   message authentication codes (MACs). Typically, message
   authentication codes are used between two parties that share a secret
   key in order to authenticate information transmitted between these
   parties. This Standard defines a MAC that uses a cryptographic hash
   function in conjunction with a secret key. This mechanism is called
   HMAC [HMAC]. HMAC shall use an Approved cryptographic hash function
   [FIPS180-3]. HMAC uses the secret key for the calculation and
   verification of the MACs.
