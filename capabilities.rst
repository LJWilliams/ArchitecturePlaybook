NFR Capabilities
===========================

This appendix provides some a very few examples of NFRs.
Having good NFRs is crucial for your solution. Asking users to provide NFRs is not the best way to success. More productive is to discuss NFRs with your users that you think are worth discussing. Some NFRs, e.g. for availability, MUST BE discussed since this has severe consequence for the solution and maintenance costs. Some NFRs e.g. for security MUST BE implemented and are not really suited for users discussions. Most of the time you will be confronted with bad NFRs for your architecture after realization. So you better do it right from the start.
