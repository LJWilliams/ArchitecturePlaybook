Data Architecture
=================

Every business, small or large SHOULD have a data architecture. In the
core a data architecture gives the overview and insights into the only
one real value of your IT: Information. A data architecture gives
overviews, visuals and describes e.g.:

-  What data is used where and how.
-  Who owns what data.
-  How is information created from data sources.
-  Internal and external data sources used.
-  Privacy & Security aspects of data (so be sure to have an data owner)
-  What structures, objects and relations are the core of your
   information model?

Tools for creating a data architecture
--------------------------------------

To speed up the process for creating a data architecture you SHOULD use
tools. Below is a selection of tools that will speed up the process of
creating your data architecture. Be aware that data modelling and
database design are two very different activities.  The emphase for a
data architecture SHOULD be on the conceptual and logical data models.
In general  physical data models are related to the sql or nosql storage
engine used, in combination with scalability(performance) and security
requirements.

-  *Data Principles*.(See the data principles section in this book.)
   Using data principles saves you time and cost. Especially in the long
   term. Selecting data principles you need in your project of a solid
   collection gives you a head start.
-  `Protégé <http://protege.stanford.edu/>`__. Protégé is a free, open
   source ontology editor and knowledge-base framework. This open-source
   ontology editor and framework can be used for for building
   intelligent systems. The tool is developed by the Stanford Center for
   Biomedical Informatics Research and has a large and active community
   of users and developers.
-  `Archi <http://www.archimatetool.com/>`__.  Archi™ GUI tool for
   creating an architecture, using the ArchiMate modelling™ language.
   Since Archi is targeted to all architecture aspects, this tool is
   usuable for creating conceptual, logical and physical data models
   too.
-  `WWW SQL Designer <https://github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner>`__. 
   This tool allows you to draw and create database schemas (E-R
   diagrams) directly in browser. A physical data model (sql) can also
   be imported and adjusted visually.
-  `MySQL Workbench <http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/>`__. MySQL
   Workbench enables a DBA, developer, or data architect to visually
   design, model, generate, and manage databases. It includes everything
   a data modeler needs for creating complex ER models, forward and
   reverse engineering, and also delivers key features for performing
   difficult change management and documentation tasks that normally
   require much time and effort.
-  `JSON
   Schema <https://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/>`__.
   Nice short book that gives you help with creating your JSON Schema.    
-  `DrawIO <https://www.draw.io/>`__. This online FOSS program can be used to create all thinkable data diagrams. It's a very advanced, but still a simple to use program. The source can be found on https://github.com/jgraph/drawio if you want to host it yourself.
