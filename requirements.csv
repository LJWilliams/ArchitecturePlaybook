Clock Identity Authentication and Authorization,QoS(Quality-of-Service),"The security mechanism MUST support authentication.
Authentication refers to verifying the identity of the peer clock. Authorization, on the other hand, refers to verifying that the peer clock is permitted to play the role that it plays in the protocol.  For example, some nodes may be permitted to be masters,while other nodes are only permitted to be slaves or TCs. Authentication is typically implemented by means of a cryptographic signature, allowing the verification of the identity of the sender.  Authorization requires clocks to maintain a list of authorized clocks, or a ""black list"" of clocks that should be denied service or revoked.",Could,Security,,

This Standard defines methods for digital signature generation that can be used for the protection of binary data (commonly called a message), and for the verification and validation of those digital signatures. Three techniques are approved.
(1) The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is specified in this Standard. The specification includes criteria for the generation of domain parameters, for the generation of public and private key pairs, and for the generation and verification of digital signatures.
(2) The RSA digital signature algorithm is specified in American National Standard (ANS) X9.31 and Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #1. FIPS 186-4 approves the use of implementations of either or both of these standards and specifies additional requirements.
(3) The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is specified in ANS X9.62. FIPS 186-4 approves the use of ECDSA and specifies additional requirements. Recommended elliptic curves for Federal Government use are provided herein.

FIPS PUB 198-1:The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code  (HMAC),Business,"FIPS PUB 198-1:The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code  (HMAC)
Providing a way to check the integrity of information transmitted over or stored in an unreliable medium is a prime necessity in the world of open computing and communications. Mechanisms that provide such integrity checks based on a secret key are usually called message authentication codes (MACs). Typically, message authentication codes are used between two parties that share a secret key in order to authenticate information transmitted between these parties. This Standard defines a MAC that uses a cryptographic hash function in conjunction with a secret key. This mechanism is called HMAC [HMAC]. HMAC shall use an Approved cryptographic hash function [FIPS180-3]. HMAC uses the secret key for the calculation and verification of the MACs.

The objective of this standard is to facilitate the development, approval, and deployment of PCI-approved P2PE solutions that will increase the protection of account data by encrypting that data from the point of interaction within the encryption environment where account data is captured through to the point of decrypting that data inside the decryption environment, effectively removing clear-text account data between these two points. The requirements contained within this standard are intended for P2PE solution providers and other entities that provide P2PE components or P2PE applications for use in P2PE solutions, as well as P2PE assessors evaluating these entities. Additionally, merchants benefit from using P2PE solutions due to increased protection of account data and subsequent reduction in the presence of clear -text account data within their environments.

These algorithms enable the determination of a message’s integrity: any change to the message will, with a very high probability, result in a different message digest.
The digests are used to detect whether messages have been changed since the digests were generated.
