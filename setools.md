# System Engineering Tools 

## Capella

Capella is an Open Source Solution for Model-Based Systems Engineering. It is based on the Arcadia method. This is a system engineering method based on the use of models, with a focus on the collaborative definition, evaluation and exploitation of its architecture. This method is very tight related to SySML but with less hassle to use.

Capella is a great FOSS tool but has a steep learning curve  to get familiar with creating models.

## Gaphor

Gaphor is a UML and SysML modeling application written in Python. It is designed to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements a fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture drawing tool. You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects of a system as well as create complete, highly complex models.
