# Templates

Templates make sure you deliver always a minimum quality.
Templates SHOULD BE tailored for your problem context. So skip what is not needed and extend it with items that are uttermost important for your architecture!

You can reuse each template by downloading it (as markdown) and adjust it to your needs.
