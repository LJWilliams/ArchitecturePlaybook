## Executive summary 

This document is created to serve as input for an automatic Business
Case generator.

HELP TEXT:

The Executive Summary should provide a short, informative headline

no longer than 1 page and contain:

• A short narrative to identify the subject, scope, method of analysis
and key results and findings;

• A short list of the key objectives of the project

• A summary of the financial metrics ( table below, provides a very
basic and high-level example of summarizing outlay and ROI)) from the
investigation, highlighting the most significant;

A brief summary of the conclusions as a result of the study

## Introduction 

HELP Text:

This section should describe the setting, background and context of the
Business Case. It should serve to clarify and elaborate the subject
matter of the Business Case. It should clearly state the purpose of the
Business Case, e.g.

• To obtain financial approval to either commence a project or proceed
to the next stage;

• To compare alternative solutions, etc…

It should explain the objectives, needs or problems addressed by the
requirement. The objectives should be stated in clear and measurable
terms with a specified time frame, e.g.:

• To have improved communication systems against more competitive cost
options from December 2007

• To invest £xx in a performance improvement project that will
ultimately provide a 10:1 return on the initial investment (spend to
save)

It should outline any relevant related initiatives – is the project part
of a larger programme? Are there dependencies on the delivery of other
projects to realise the benefits?

It should include a statement how the project is “right-sized”; that is
ensuring that the proposed solution is realistically scoped to ensure
that the benefits and costs to deliver are in line.

## Scope

### Boundaries

*Define what is to be included within the scope of the investment and
explicitly state what is excluded from the investment.*

### Stakeholder Analysis

\[link to module?\]

investment is striving to achieve at the end of an intervention or
change.

## Assessment of benefits

HELP Text:

The benefits to be gained from the investment compared to the
alternative of ‘doing nothing’ should be summarised. Benefits should be
identified and quantified, as far as possible, in financial terms: as
appropriate, this to include projected cost reduction against
investments, impact if no investment,, reduction in risk, improvements
in quality, reliability, accuracy and other tangible, non-tangible and
consequential benefit i.e. ‘what are the real benefits from making the
investment?’

A full assessment / explanation of the benefits should be included as an
Annex if appropriate.

Optional per scenario:

\[SOWT analyse\]

## Cost / Benefits Assessment

HELP TEXT:

*This will clearly identify the cost benefit against the investment that
is being made. This should consist of a simplified presentation of the
financial cost/benefit analysis - presented in tables or graphs;*

*This should include an assessment of:*

  - *Investment value – Revenue and Capital*

  - *Cost Saving first 12 months (£)*

  - *Cost Saving after first year (£)*

  - *Depreciation costs*

  - *Total cost (£)*

  - *Cash outlay (£)*

Additionally, an assessment of unquantified Benefits and Costs, and
Strategic Contribution should be considered:

  - *Try very hard to quantify all costs and benefits*

  - *All direct costs should be included*

  - *Indirect costs should be included*

  - *If a non-financial benefit is significant, then define it*

*Make the impact of the benefit tangible – describe all likely effects
and implication*

## Recommended option

HELP TEXT:

*When formulating an investment proposal the options available,
including the ‘do nothing’ option, should be considered and compared.
Based on the outcome of the comparison of the options i.e. the option
appraisal, a recommendation should be made for one option.*

*The full option appraisal should include a cost/benefit/risk comparison
between the options available to address the business problem /
opportunity. Options to include ‘do nothing’, business and technical
options, timing options and, if at all relevant, consideration of
3<sup>rd</sup> party involvement – contractors, joint ventures
partnerships, PFI and funding options. When considering options,
relevant strategies, standards and legal requirements should be taken
into account.*

*Depending on the situation the option appraisal may be simply
qualitative or a detailed analysis. It may be done in two stages i.e. a
broad sift of a wide range of options followed by a detailed examination
of say, 3 of them.*

### Risk and Sensitivity analysis

<tr class="odd">
<td><p><em>The key business risks associated with the recommended option should be summarised, particularly those which may impact on the financial projections (costs and/or benefits).
